# amazon simulator


I want to make a game out of the feeling I get when I buy shit from amazon.
I don't have a lot of thoughts on that yet, but I think it could be an amazing game.

## mechanics

There could be some idea of a quest where you have to purchase something.
You would need to do research before purchasing, and maybe read through reviews.
We could have the gameplay be something like paper's please maybe?

I want to make something like tradewinds, perhaps that could be incorporated into this game.

Maybe cookie clicker kind of?

There could be some kind of aspect where you have to time deliveries and be home to receive them, so you'd be juggling other shit with being home to sign for deliveries.

We could get hipster as fuck and make this into some kind of depression quest game. That stupid stuff has been popular, but this could actually be artistic.
You would have to fill the void in your life with buying shit from amazon, but you don't want to become a hoarder. You might need to hide your addiction from your family or neighbors.

Maybe part of the game is trying to scam amazon into getting free shit.

## continued

There are preset levels with goals. You need to be able to aquire X items in X days.
If you become too unhappy, bad shit happens.
The background color/music can reflect your current mood.
There should be lightning deals that you can miss out on.
Different orders have different happiness functions. We can represent them as a polynomial, and you need to balance quick fixes with long term improvements if you want to make it.
If you can afford amazon prime, you don't have to wait as long, but you need to be able to pay for it.
Your job is cookie clicker basically.
Credit card tradeoffs?

I want you to be destitute at first, maybe you can get a promotion if you're happy enough and work well. If you work too well, you don't have time to buy shit on amazon and you get depressed.

Quick time events?
Arbitrary decisions that have lasting effects on the game mechanics?
